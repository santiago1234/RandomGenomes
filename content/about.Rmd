I am a bioinformatician working in [Ariel Bazzini's lab](https://research.stowers.org/bazzinilab/index.html) at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. [Here](https://github.com/santiago1234/CV/blob/master/CV.pdf) you can find my CV.

My research aims to better understand biological systems by extracting information from omics datasets.

I’m interested in:

* Computational Biology
* Bayesian Statistics
* Machine Learning
